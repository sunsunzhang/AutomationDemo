Let me show you how I create this project. I was base on the keyword and tourtial before to combine the java together. Due to the development is set on ubuntu, I can share you more pictures for the test result or execute it.

Here is the step:
1 search on google 'jave get page content'
https://www.mkyong.com/java/how-to-get-url-content-in-java/

2 After get the content, I found this is the json file and it is quite simuliar with the tourtial I learned before. So I follow the simuliar framework.

3 Regarding to the TestNG, I have another tourtial to refer.

4 Install git in ubuntu

Imprvment:
Due to the time limit, I was hard coded part of the codes, like location, expect result. Hope you can understand it.
